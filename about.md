1. This project rigorously researches and studies existing specifications and reuses suitable existing work wherever possible. It looks for existing specifications that balance breadth of adoption with quality of modeling. It **prioritizes reuse over novelty**.

1. This specification satisfies a broad range of use cases, without requiring an exhaustive vocabulary of terms. It **focuses on flexibility** to do more with fewer terms.

1. A fact that many specifications overlook is that our knowledge of the world is imprecise and uncertain. This specification attempts, as much as possible, to make it easy to represent **real world data** while preserving clarity and meaning.
