## Principles

Taking inspiration from the [GDS Design Principles](https://www.gov.uk/design-principles):

1. Start with needs
1. Do less
1. Design with data
1. Do the hard work to make it simple
1. Iterate. Then iterate again.
1. Build for inclusion
1. Understand context
1. Build digital services, not websites
1. Be consistent, not uniform
