<p class="lead">Localo is a <a href="http://localgovdigital.info/localgov-digital-makers">LocalGov Digital Makers</a> project to create by community consensus <strong>local government data and <abbr title="Application Programming Interface">API</abbr> specifications</strong> relating to the services and information provided by local government.</p>

  	<h3>What is Localo?</h3>

  	<p>In local government we tend to buy line of business systems by service and for a specific task (e.g. Planning or Cleansing) and often from a big supplier. Typically they're not very open being either difficult and/or expensive to get data in or out which makes things difficult when we want to be able to integrate systems to allow end-to-end digital services which means users should be able to view current and correct information as well as transact in real-time. Councils also want to be able to evaluate performance which relies on being able to access appropriate data from their line of business systems. When access to the data within the line of business systems is possible, it's often bespoke. This means the other systems using data from the line of business systems would need to be updated if there was a change to, or replacement of, that system increasing cost and time required which potentially affects the viability of making the change.</p>

  	<h4>What if we could standardise the integrations?</h4>

  	<p>That's what the Localo project aims to do! There are two parts to the project.</p>

  	<p>The first is the <strong>data models</strong>. Data models specify how to describe a <em>thing</em>. Taking a bin as an example the table below shows what some of the standard attributes might be:</p>

  	<dl class="dl-horizontal">
		<dt>Size</dt>
		<dd>This could be the size or capacity of the container in litres.</dd>
		<dt>Type</dt>
		<dd>This could be the type of container e.g. <samp>wheeled bin</samp>, <samp>sack</samp>, <samp>box</samp>, <samp>caddy</samp>. Depending on the scenario this list of types could be fixed, there could be suggested values or it could be open to any value</dd>
		<dt>Colour</dt>
		<dd>This could be the colour of the container and like <code>Type</code>, could be open or have a list of values. Alternatively it could be something that computers understand such as a hex code <samp>#000000</samp> (the hex code for black)</dd>
	</dl>

  	<p>The second part of the project is to develop an <strong>API specification</strong>. APIs are a mechanism for other applications and hardware to interact with a system. These typically use web technologies so analogy for an API is they are a set of web pages that don't make much sense to humans, but do to machines! They are an integral part of how the systems in companies such as Amazon, Google, Facebook, PayPal and Twitter work.</p>

  	<p>The <strong>Gubbins of Government</strong> video below by <a href="https://fodengrealy.com/">Foden Grealy</a> explains in "plainish English" how new technology can change government for the better.</p>
